    <h1> Top Three Creeds I Have Practiced </h1>
</div> 
<div>
<h3 class="num"> Number 1: </h3>
<div class="div">
   <h4> I Shall Lead By Example </h4>
    <p> This creed is very important to me. It reminds me to always be my best self, in order to set the example. The way that I show this creed is by always doing what seems right, helping my friends, doing my work, and paying attention in class. I do this all to lead by example and hopefully inspire people. </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3 class="num"> Number 2: </h3>
<div class="div"> 
    <h4> I Believe Nothing Is Hard Just A Lot Of Work </h4>
    <p> This creed is also very important to me. Ever since I first heard it, it stuck with me. This is because it really changed my mindset over what I could accomplish. I practice this creed by fixing my mindset into knowing that I can accomplish any task that I put myself up to. </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3 class="num"> Number 2: </h3>
<div class="div">
    <h4> I Will Strive To Know Myself Better And Seek Self-Improvement </h4>
    <p> This creed is a reminder that I can always improve. I believe that this creed is one of the most important because if you don't strive for finding your weaknesses, you'l never grow. I have been practicing this creed by searching for activities that allow me to learn new skills, like this program. </p>
